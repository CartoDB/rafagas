    desc: Rational Water Resources Management requires effective collaboration between
      decision-makers involved in the operational management of water resources and
      scientists, who can allow them to operate in an informed manner through forecasting
      and decision-making tools. In this article, we show the potential benefits resulting
      from this collaboration through the description of the emblematic case of Lake
      Como. The article describes the real case of a collaborative experience between
      decision makers, who made an effort to highlight and clarify the real management
      problems to scientists, who in turn needed to understand all the facets of the
      decision-making process prior to formulating the problem in mathematical terms
      and incorporating the solution into a decision support system. The resulting
      tool, which makes extensive hidden use of probabilistic forecasts, stochastic
      optimization, and Bayesian decision techniques, resulted in a user-friendly
      environment. After six months of testing, the tool proved to be essential for
      decision-making and has been in use on a daily basis since 1997.
