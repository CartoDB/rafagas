    desc: 'In this article we present three instruments: (1) a social vulnerability
      to extreme heat index to identify the areas of a city (and populations thereof)
      more vulnerable to extreme heat due to climate change (heat islands); (2) a
      new overall fragility index that incorporates social vulnerability to extreme
      heat as well as socioeconomic indicators; and (3) a climate shelter index (CSI)
      to identify areas within a city that can provide relief from extreme heat based
      on green and blue solutions. We elaborated these three indexes to measure social
      vulnerability to extreme heat in the municipality of Bologna, which serves as
      this article’s case study. By analyzing the connections between social vulnerability
      to extreme heat and several socio-demographic variables in Bologna, we found
      that a decrease in income is significantly correlated with an increase in social
      vulnerability to extreme heat in urban contexts. A comparison between our new
      overall fragility index and the existing index adopted by the municipality of
      Bologna (Indice di fragilità, Comune di Bologna) showed that about 75% of the
      statistical areas observed are worse off when social vulnerability to extreme
      heat is also considered. Considering social vulnerability to extreme heat shows
      vulnerabilities in a city (here: Bologna) that the pre-existing index did not
      consider. These findings and our new indexes can support the Bologna administration
      (and other local administrations) in addressing the consequences of climate
      change for their most vulnerable residents.'
