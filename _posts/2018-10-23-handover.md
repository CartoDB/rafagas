Raf Roset is handing over his daily effort to collect links and share them on a daily basis (the friendly named "Ráfagas"). A group of enthusiastic followers want to be sure this effort is worth to be continued so we ask you for your feedback. You can get more context and related information [here](http://bit.ly/rafagas-2).

So please, take a minute to answer [the feedback survey](http://bit.ly/rafagas-2-feedback) and feel free to discuss about the planned sunset (unless we do something!) of this nice effort using the [Ráfagas mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/rafagas).
