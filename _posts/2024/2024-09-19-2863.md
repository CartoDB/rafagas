      to map them all â€” and is uncovering untold stories along the way.

    desc: The Congo Basin rainforest is the second-largest tropical forest in the
      world, storing large volumes of carbon and hosting high levels of biodiversity.
      While these forests have historically stayed mostly intact, road development
      has recently become a critical threat. A new study has used satellite images
      and artificial intelligence to map Congo Basin forest roads in unprecedented
      detail. This provides crucial new information for forest conservation and management.
