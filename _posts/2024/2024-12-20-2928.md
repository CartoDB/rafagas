    desc: When exploring different forests, one might notice the distinct character
      that each possesses. Some are open and bright with tall trees and dispersed
      meadows, while others are dense and dark due to tightly packed vegetation. The
      diverse arrangement of trees, leaves and branches in a forest that give it these
      characteristics is what scientists refer to as its “structural complexity.”
