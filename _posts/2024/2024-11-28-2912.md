    desc: 'Every year for Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM), we put together a real-time
      visualization of purchases made through Shopify-powered merchants worldwide.
      This year we’re cooking up something big, and in anticipation we wanted to show
      you how we built the globe last year. Video of BFCM 2023 Globe Besides going
      for better visuals, a big focus was performance. We’ve put together an interactive
      deep dive into how we built and optimized the 3D visuals using technologies
      such as Three.js and React-three-fiber.

      Before we jump in, here’s the globe with simulated data that you can play with.
      Arcs

      The arcs flying around are the most important component. Each one represents
      an order being placed in real time, and they travel from the merchant to the
      buyer’s location.

      These can be defined as a Bézier curve with 4 control points. Each point is
      a 3-dimensional vector. P0: located at start position

      P1: located 25% of the way between start and end

      P2: located 75% of the way between start and end

      P3: located at end position Arc height can be adjusted by moving control points
      P1 and P2 away from the surface.

      To render the arc, we create a mesh that is a strip of triangles moving along
      the curve. This gives us the ability to control thickness and have better flexibility
      for stylizing it with shaders. You’ll notice however that as you move the mesh
      around, it disappears from certain angles. We needed a way to make it always
      face the viewer. The solution was surprisingly simple.

      The red lines along the curve represent the tangent at those points. Taking
      the cross product of the tangent with the direction of the camera gives a new
      vector. This is used in the vertex shader to offset the position so the mesh
      always faces the viewer. To texture the arcs, the UVs of the mesh are defined
      with v going from 0 at the start to 1 at the end. So a vertex in the middle
      of the'
