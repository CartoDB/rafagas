    desc: Have you ever noticed that your Maps app still works during a flight? It
      can feel illicit, like someone just forgot to turn off the signal, and that
      watching yourself crawl along the earth should be done without drawing undue
      attention. A few months ago I learned that there were only around 30 GPS satellites
      serving the entire planet. This piqued my interest, because it reminded me of
      the 13 root DNS servers from which all resolution flows. Perhaps GPS has a similar
      design in which the ‘source of truth’ is diluted by several layers of signal
      repeaters? I navigated to gps.gov, and was presented with this delightful image.
      I became even more excited to learn about what these satellites do!
