      For the FAQ, expand this window: --- How can I share this map with a simpler
      URL? Easy - just use https://regen.earth --- How can I submit a video/project?
      Send suggestions via https://spherical.studio/contact/ --- Why are you doing
      this? We wanted to know the stories of the field of practitioners bringing their
      world(s) to life. It’s a labor of love, mostly to express gratitude to this
      remarkable community. --- How do you pick the placenames? We’ve done our best
      to categorize these projects by location, but many of these territories have
      multiple names. Many of the projects are located on unceded and/or Indigenous
      lands. For more about traditional placenames and details about Indigenous lands,
      see https://native-land.ca --- Has the map been used elsewhere? We’re delighted
      to report that many of these projects have now been enshrined in the science
      fiction canon by Kim Stanley Robinson, who gave voice to this map in his latest
      book Ministry for the Future: http://tiny.cc/tmftf --- What are the criteria
      for selection? We curate the map for projects that: a) are inspiring in their
      ambition and scope and b) have had a short or long-form documentary made about
      them. Of course there are many remarkable regenerative projects in the world,
      so this is simply an effort to illuminate the expanding field. Unfortunately,
      due to the technical limitations of Google My Maps, the videos must be on YouTube
      (not Vimeo or other platforms). --- Why are you doing this? We want to showcase
      tangible examples of the how diverse communities are collaborating to benefit
      the regeneration of Earth’s living systems. --- How can I view the videos for
      each project? In a laptop or desktop browser, click a project pin then click
      the image that appears in the column on the left. This will display a YouTube
      video over the map. If the project has multiple videos, an arrow will appear
      to the right of the first video. Click on it to view additional videos and photos.
      In a tablet browser, click a project pin then click the image that appears at
      the bottom of the screen. Unfortunately, the video functionality is unpredictable
      on mobile phones. This is a technical limitation of Google’s My Maps. --- Who
      created/curates/maintains this? We are Spherical (http://spherical.studio).
      Our studio explores the potential of maps, stories, and metaphors to help transform
      relationships to the world and each other. --- How long have you been doing
      this? We started this map in December of 2016. --- Thank you for all of your
      suggestions thus far. Keep ’em coming. ---'
