    desc: A number of specialist units were involved in regularly carrying out precision
      surveying close to the French coast, sometimes landing to collect data and information.
      These units included hydrographic surveyors, swimmers and canoeists (like the
      Forfar Force), and the Combined Operations Pilotage Parties (C.O.P.P.). The
      units operated out of Warsash and Hayling Island respectively, and would report
      back details such as the geological make up of the various beaches, and the
      nature of the German coastal defences.
