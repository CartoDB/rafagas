    desc: The European Space Agency’s Sentinel satellites have laid the foundation
      for global land use land cover (LULC) mapping with unprecedented detail at 10
      m resolution. We present a cross-comparison and accuracy assessment of Google’s
      Dynamic World (DW), ESA’s World Cover (WC) and Esri’s Land Cover (Esri) products
      for the first time in order to inform the adoption and application of these
      maps going forward. For the year 2020, the three global LULC maps show strong
      spatial correspondence (i.e., near-equal area estimates) for water, built area,
      trees and crop LULC classes. However, relative to one another, WC is biased
      towards over-estimating grass cover, Esri towards shrub and scrub cover and
      DW towards snow and ice. Using global ground truth data with a minimum mapping
      unit of 250 m2, we found that Esri had the highest overall accuracy (75%) compared
      to DW (72%) and WC (65%). Across all global maps, water was the most accurately
      mapped class (92%), followed by built area (83%), tree cover (81%) and crops
      (78%), particularly in biomes characterized by temperate and boreal forests.
      The classes with the lowest accuracies, particularly in the tundra biome, included
      shrub and scrub (47%), grass (34%), bare ground (57%) and flooded vegetation
      (53%). When using European ground truth data from LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area
      Frame Survey) with a minimum mapping unit of <100 m2, we found that WC had the
      highest accuracy (71%) compared to DW (66%) and Esri (63%), highlighting the
      ability of WC to resolve landscape elements with more detail compared to DW
      and Esri. Although not analyzed in our study, we discuss the relative advantages
      of DW due to its frequent and near real-time data delivery of both categorical
      predictions and class probability scores. We recommend that the use of global
      LULC products should involve critical evaluation of their suitability with respect
      to the application purpose, such as aggregate changes in ecosystem accounting
      versus site-specific change detection in monitoring, considering trade-offs
      between thematic resolution, global versus. local accuracy, class-specific biases
      and whether change analysis is necessary. We also emphasize the importance of
      not estimating areas from pixel-counting alone but adopting best practices in
      design-based inference and area estimation that quantify uncertainty for a given
      study area.
