    desc: 'Summary: I’ve created a demo web app where you can search an aerial photo
      of Southampton, UK using text queries such as “roundabout”, “tennis court” or
      “ship”. It uses vector embeddings to do this – which I explain in this blog
      post.'

    desc: At the start of 2024 I was contacted by the Prévention MAIF association
      to support them in a sensitive mapping process in the Roya Valley. After several
      discussions with Aveline Carmoi and Angello Smaniotto, I proposed doing a sensitive
      and participatory cartography residency in order to; 1/ meet local stakeholders,
      immerse myself in local issues and dynamics, 2/ raise awareness of the sensitive
      and participatory mapping approach of the territory and 3/ sketch a participatory
      map of the Roya valley with local stakeholders.
