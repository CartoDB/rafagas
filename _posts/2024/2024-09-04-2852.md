    desc: Enables access to origin-destination (OD) provided by the Spanish Minstry
      of Transport, hosted at <https://www.transportes.gob.es/ministerio/proyectos-singulares/estudios-de-movilidad-con-big-data/opendata-movilidad>.
      It contains functions for downloading zone boundaries and associated origin-destination
      data. The OD datasets are large. The package eases working with them by using
      the database interface package duckdb, using an optional environment variable
      SPANISH_OD_DATA_DIR to avoid repeated downloads, and by providing documentation
      demonstrating how to collect subsets of the resulting databases into memory.
