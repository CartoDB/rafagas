**71 people** participated in [the survey](http://bit.ly/rafagas-2-feedback), most of them were current readers and mostly coming from the **mailing lists** in Catalan, even a significant number also used **Twitter** as the way to consume them.

**More than half** of the participants would be interested on sending links, and quite a few would be willing to help on curating them. As most of the people answering the survey come from the Catalan speaking mailing lists, language preference would also be first **Catalan**, then **English**.

Finally, the majority of the participants agree on a **weekly** basis.

A few highlight comments:

> “Love it. Maybe too much. Condense a bit”
>
> “I use the links to share current GIS events with students.”
>
> "Being honest, I didn't know about it and it is a shame that I missed it. I had a look before answer the survey and I really like the idea and sources. I think it is really good resource and quite interesting for Gis professionals or map lovers.
>
> “This is a wonderful resource that I use often . . . I am a teacher in Kathmandu, Nepal at an international school. These resources are great to bring into the classroom. I am thankful that an old university friend that works at Carto in DC turned me on to this. I am hopeful that this will continue. Cheers!”
